# modestmaps-go

ModestMaps. In Go.

## Caveats

This package is a straight port of modestmaps-py to Go. It does not work yet. It hasn't been tested yet. It's not clear how the use of sub-classing in the Python version best maps to Go's interfaces.

In short, you should not try to use this package yet.
